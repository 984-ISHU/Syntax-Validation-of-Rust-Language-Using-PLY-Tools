# Syntax-Validation-of-Rust-Language-Using-PLY-Tools

Syntax Validation of Rust language by writing the Context Free Grammar. (PLY Tools)
Built lexer(lex_rust.py) and parser files (yacc_rust.py) and validated the syntax of Rust Code written in text file (exampleInput.txt).

## List of constructs built:

+ Variable Declaration
+ Function Definition
+ Structure Definition
+ For Loop
+ If-else Statements

*All 5 constructs can be used at once and they do support nesting.*
